  <h1>Gaya City</h1>

  <p>
    Gaya (IAST: GayƒÅ) is a city, municipal corporation and the administrative headquarters of Gaya district
    and
    Magadh division of the Indian state of Bihar. Gaya is 116 kilometres (72 mi) south of Patna and is the
    state's second-largest city, with a population of 470,839. The city is surrounded on three sides by
    small,
    rocky hills (Mangla-Gauri, Shringa-Sthan, Ram-Shila, and Brahmayoni), with the Phalgu River on its
    eastern
    side.
  </p>

  <p>
    The city of Gaya is a holy place of Hinduism, with a great number of Hindu deities represented in the
    engravings, paintings and carvings of its shrines. Of particular importance are the sites in the city
    associated with Vishnu, in particular the Phalgu River and the shrine Vishnupad Mandir, or Vishnupada,
    which
    is marked by a large footprint of Lord Vishnu engraved in a basalt block. Gaya is the location at which
    Rama, with Sita and Lakshmana, offered pind-daan for his father, Dasharatha. Gaya has since remained a
    site
    of key importance for the performance of the pind-daan ritual.

    Gaya is the second-largest contributor to the economy of Bihar, after Patna. Agriculture is the leading
    economic activity of the district. The main crops grown are rice, wheat, potatoes, and lentils.
    Livestock
    raised include cattle, buffaloes, goats and pigs. Gaya has a large number of household industries,
    producing
    incense sticks (atagarbatti), local sweets tilkut (made with sesame seed) and lai (made with poppy
    seed),
    stone-work, hand weaving, power-loom weaving, textiles and garments, small-scale manufactured goods, and
    plastic products. Small-scale industries also include agricultural services, metalworking, machinery and
    equipment production and repair services. The main vegetable market in the city is the Kedarnath Market.
    Commercial activities are located along its main roads; the city also has a large number of informal
    shops.
    As Gaya is an important centre of religious tourism, accommodation is widely available.Bodh Gaya's
    largest
    hotel is the Maha Bodhi Hotel, Resort & Convention Centre; the Sambodhi Retreat, a resort of Bihar, is
    also
    in the town.

    In the 12th century CE, Gaya was invaded by Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji of the Ghaznavid Empire. By 1557,
    it
    had become part of the Mughal Empire, and remained under its power until the Battle of Buxar and the
    beginning of British rule in 1764. Gaya, along with other parts of the country, gained its independence
    in
    1947.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gaya is named after the demon Gayasura (meaning "the demon Gaya") who dwelt the area during the Treta
    Yuga.
    According to Vayu Purana, Gaya was the name of a demon (Asura) whose body became pious after he
    performed
    strict penance and secured blessings from Lord Vishnu. It was said that the body of Gayasura was
    transformed
    into the series of rocky hills that make up the landscape of Gaya.
