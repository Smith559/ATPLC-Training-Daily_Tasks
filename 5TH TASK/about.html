    Vishnupad
    Gaya is located 100 kilometers away from the capital city of Patna. Historically, Gaya was the part of the ancient
    Magadh Empire. The city is located on the bank of Falgu River and is considered among one of the most sacred cities
    for Hindus. Three hills Mangala-Gauri, Shringa-Sthan, Ram-Shila and Brahmayoni surround it from three sides and make
    at a safe and beautiful site. Gaya is an ancient place and has great heritage and history. Various modes of
    transportation connect Gaya with other major cities of Bihar along with rest of India
    Gaya is sacred not only for Hindus but also for Buddhists, as the place has many Buddhist pilgrim destinations.
    These sacred places in Gaya correspond to physical features, most of which occur naturally. The bank sides of river
    Falgu and temples located on the bank are beautiful and attractive. A peepal tree standing on the bank of Falgu
    River called Akshayavat is considered sacred for Hindus. The tree is worshiped for its divinity

    The Mangla Gauri shrine who is believed to be the first wife of Lord Shiva is worshiped here. The two rounded stones
    that symbolize the breasts of the mythological Sati have been considered sacred among Hindus. The most attractive
    destination in Gaya is Vishnupad Temple. The temple is located on the bank of river Falgu River and has footprint of
    Vishnu incised into a block of basalt. People believe that Lord Vishnu killed Gayasur by placing his foot on
    Gayasur’s chest.
    The old temple of Vishnupad was later renovated by the queen of Indore, Devi Ahilyabai in eighteenth century. While
    Hindus claim that footprints in Vishunpad temple are of Lord Vishnu, Buddhists consider them the footprints of Lord
    Buddha. The temple is nevertheless a major pilgrim destination.

    Nomenclature of Gaya is based on the myth of demon Gayasur who Lord Vishnu had killed in a dual. The place is so
    sacred for Hindus that even Lord Ram had performed Pindadanam here for his ancestors. Legend says that Lord Ram had
    come to Gaya to pay homage to his ancestors and Sita had accompanied him on his way. Gaya is equally important for
    Buddhists as this was the place where Lord Buddha preached the Fire Sermon i.e. Adittapariyaya Sutta to around 1000
    agriculture workers who were fire-worshipers. The influence of Buddha’s discourse was so enormous that all of them
    converted to Buddhism.

    Bodhgaya
    Bodhgaya is one of the most important and sacred Buddhist pilgrimage center in the world. It was here under a banyan
    tree, the Bodhi Tree, Gautama attained supreme knowledge to become Buddha,the Enlightened One. Born; in the
    foothills of the Himalayas as a Sakya prince of Kapilvastu (now in Nepal), most of the major events of his life,
    like enlightenment and last sermon, happened in Bihar. Buddhism as a religion was really born in Bihar and evolved
    here through his preaching and the example of his lifestyle of great simplicity, renunciation and empathy for
    everything living. Significantly, the state’s name of ‘Bihar’ originated from ‘Vihara’ meaning monasteries which
    abounded in Bihar. Several centuries after Buddha’s passing away, the Maurya Emperor Ashoka (234-198 BC) contributed
    tremendously towards the revival, consolidation and spread of the original religion. It is the monasteries, Ashoka
    built for the Buddhist monks and the pillars known as Ashokan Pillars erected to commemorate innumerable historical
    sites associated with the Buddha’s life, mostly intact to this day, that helped scholars and pilgrims alike to trace
    the life events and preaching of a truly extraordinary man. There is a magnificent Mahabodhi temple and the Tree
    from the original sapling still stands in the temple premises. The temple is an architectural amalgamation of many
    centuries, cultures and heritages. While its architecture has a distinct stamp of the Gupta era, it has later ages
    inscriptions describing visits of pilgrims from Sri Lanka, Myanmar and China between 7th and 10th century AD. It is
    perhaps still the same temple Hieuen Tsang visited in 7th century.

    What to See :
    Mahabodhi Temple: The temple stands in the east to the Bodhi Tree. Its architectural effect is superb. Its basement
    is 48 square feet and it rises in the form of a slender Pyramid till it reaches its neck, which is cylindrical in
    shape. The total height of the temple is 170 ft. and on the top of the temple are Chatras which symbolize
    sovereignty of religion. Four towers on its corners rise gracefully giving the holy structure a poise balance. This
    sacred edifice is like a grand banner unfurled by time to proclaim to the world the pious efforts of the Buddha to
    solve the knots of human miseries, to ascend above worldly problems and to attain transcendental peace through
    wisdom, good conduct and disciplined life.
    nside the temple, in the main sanctum, there is a colossal image of the Buddha in sitting posture touching the earth
    by his right hand. In this posture the Buddha accomplished the supreme enlightenment. The statue is of black stone
    but it has been guilder by the devotees. The entire courtyard of the temple is studded with large number of votive
    stupas. These stupas are of all sizes built during the past 2500 years ago. Most of them are extremely elegant in
    structural beauty. The ancient railings, which surround the temple, are of the first century BC and are among the
    very interesting monuments of the century.

    meditation gazing east, under the Bodhi tree.

    exterior as well as the interior is utterly awe-inspiring. The temple reflects like a red and golden gem over a calm
    pool at the front patio. The splendid Buddha idol along with the mural paintings depicting Buddha’s life and some

    Sujata Garh / Sujata Village
    This ancient stupa is believed to be the place where Gautama Siddhartha meditated following severe penance of
    fasting before he attained enlightenment. The legend goes as that a village lady, Sujata, offered a bowl of rice
    pudding when she saw meditating Gautama severely emaciated. Gautama accepted the offer and realized the futility of
    the self deprivation. After this incident He went to meditate under the Bodhi tree and was enlightened and became
    the Buddha. It is about 2 kms from Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya.

    Dungeshwari Temple / Dungeshwari Hill
    Gautama Siddhartha is believed to have meditated at this place for 6 years before he went to Bodhgaya for the final
    realization. Two small shrines are built to commemorate this phase of Buddha. A golden emaciated Buddha sculpture
    memorising the rigid penance is enshrined in one of the cave temples and a large (about 6’ tall) Buddha’s statue in
    the other. A Hindu goddess deity Dungeshwari is also placed inside the cave temple.</p>
